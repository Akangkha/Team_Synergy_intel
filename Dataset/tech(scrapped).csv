With 4 cores and 8 threads, this processor still handles gaming and streaming very well. Apart from it's great overclocking capabilities, the age of the processor is beginning to show. Since the processor was made for older motherboards, compatibility with newer technologies (such as DDR4 Memory and NVMe Solid State Drives for example) is non-existent. While this may not matter for most consumers, for those who want the best value for their money, this processor is not a good choice. However, it can be recommended if you ALREADY own a motherboard capable of overclocking that is compatible with the i7-3770K. If you don't have a motherboard that can overclock the processor, it is recommended that you buy an i7-3770 non 'K' variant, as this will mirror the performance of the 'K' variant.

With a slight OC@ 4.15GHz with basic fan cooler, Asus ROG Maximus V Gene Z77, 2x4GB DDR3 PC3-12800 @1600MHz, GTX 970, 600 Watt Power Supply. When stressed using 3DMark Time Spy Extreme 4K the temp will get to 80c. Able to perform Video Editing & Rendering at 1080p but is bit slow compared to i7-6700K & even slower to newer CPU's with 6 or 8 cores. Able to play most current games with a GTX 1080ti however does bottleneck & FPS is lower than expected. All Ivy Bridge cpu's do not support 4K as it lacks HEVC ability, need 4th Gen Haswell or newer. In 2020, we have 10th Generation Intel CPU's & AMD Ryzen series or Threadripper with DDR4 memory at high speeds. So for a cpu of 7 gens ago still going strong for those staying at 1080p resolution. In time, move up from Ivy Bridge to Skylake or Coffee Lake for 4K as it'll be very affordable. The i7-3770 is a keeper & useable probably until 2022. Best budget cpu around for $50. The i7-3770K is in demand & very overpriced at $120 to $150. You can build an i7-3770 PC for well under $400 (case, mobo, psu, ram, cpu, GXT 760, 500GB HDD). However, for $1,300 you can purchase a current PC that has more potential & longer life expectancy. For those with little or no financial limitations can spend $4k to $6k to have Top of the Line everything. AMD built PC's are a little cheaper than Intel as could save $100 to $200 but there are a few Cons as to why AMD is cheaper. Beware of Retail pre-built systems at Walmart, Best Buy & other stores as hidden facts that the manufacturer & retailers fails to tell you. They are generally overpriced & built with lesser quality parts. Marketing schemes & how things are worded make you think you are getting a Deal. Maybe you are or maybe Not.

That being said, at about $350 (USD), it was very shortly thereafter made virtually obsolete by AMD's new Ryzen 7 series (8-core/16-thread) processors. Sure, the 7700K still had the performance crown for single-core speed and overclocked frequency range, but it was hard to argue against 8-cores/16-threads for around the same or less money and Intel knew it. Fast forward just a few months and Intel rushed the release of its Coffee Lake (8th Gen Core Series) processors because AMD was simply putting too much pressure on them. Surprisingly, rather than feeling entirely alienated and exploited by Intel, many people welcomed the new processor lineup, topped by the 6-core/12-thread i7-8700K, and seem to have bought them in droves; ""fanboyism"" (and/or loss aversion) is still alive and well. Back to the 7700K, for what it is, it's pretty good, even if it's really just a 6700K with slightly increased clock speeds and identical IPC. In 2019, it's still an excellent processor, particularly for gaming. There are a select few modern core-heavy games that give it some trouble (i.e., they do better with 6-core or more CPUs), but they're few and far between at the moment. And when overclocked, it only gets better... and hotter (not in a good way). I managed to get mine for a halfway reasonable price, mostly out of curiosity (I think I had just bought a Ryzen 5 1600, too). I probably should have waited, but I don't think anyone really knew that Intel would release an new lineup so quickly. Regardless, I can quite easily get 5 GHz out of mine at less than 1.35V. It sure gets hot, though. I use a Noctua NH-D15 on mine, which does an admirable job cooling it, but the thermal density of these monolithic chips just makes them inherently hot. I may delid mine at some point, but I'm not sure yet.",5 years ago.

People with ""brand new"" systems (because you know the newer the better right?) were averaging the same or slightly better depending on how well the user applied their components. Sure some systems far exceeded my roughly 7 to 8yo system but then again those systems cost over $2000 to $3000 and more. I buy everything USED or open box, etc...

For Gaming, clock speed is best and intel always has the highest clocks, lowest System latency in games and highest overclocking headroom, for all your components. If you want to render a monkey head then buy a higher end intel chip and you can game on it for years to come as well as render that image, although maybe 30 seconds slower maybe. There are many ways to overclock zintel boards, and all core is popular to hit 5.0-5.1 ghz with safe voltages, but also use per core overclock where you can set 5.4 /5.3 to 1 or 2 cores, and 5.1 to the rest or some combination. Use included fans for vrm (the things around the cpu) cooling, or add your own for cheap, $10. If you have asus, increase the cooler score as much as possible by adding push pull fan configs to your radiator etc, and increase the ai optimism scale as high as it goes, this will drop your voltages, if its not stable, add more cooling, or decrease the core ratios.

Some will cite that last gen consoles were also 8 cores and quad cores were fine then on the desktop, but Jaguar cores had IPC comparable to Athlon 64 Windsor cores which was awful even at the time, and did not have SMT meaning a quad core i7 offered as many logical cores as the ps4/xbone did while having massively higher IPC in spite of their physical core deficit; the next gen Zen 2 cpu's will leverage competitive IPC along with SMT (8c + 16t) to the fullest extent, and it only seems logical to match that as a minimum for a gaming rig you don't plan to upgrade for at least 5 years.",3 years ago.

Comparing this to the 10900K, the 10900K is cheaper, better multi-core, less TDP. But the 11900K has a huge advantage: Better single-core. For gamers, the choice is obvious. But for people who need multi-core performance like their life depends on it, the AMD Ryzen 5950X is the best choice out there. And it has lower TDP, so for people who love multi-core performance, the 5950X is the best choice. Though, it comes with a price. And at that point, a 10900K + More ram or faster SSD is the better value. Conclusion for gamers: The 11th gen CPUs are terrific.

Crazy what the benches are now, if you have Phenom II now with a mobo that works it may be useful (but they aren't very power efficient) but I burnt my mobo out overclocking so the point of what either processor could do 5 much less 10 years later is pretty moot.",3 years ago.

It is a surprisingly good processor especially as an upgrade from older Core 2 CPU's the difference in framerate for more demanding games is incredibly high especially compared to its predecessors. From personal experience, I spent about 2-3 dollars (AUD) for this processor and easily got double the framerate in Team Fortress 2. At the time and even currently I only play a few relatively undemanding games such as TF2 and HOI4. For more CPU reliant games like GTA V however it's okay but it stutters a lot more due to it only having two cores and a relatively low cache compared to more modern processors.

The 3.1Ghz all-core turbo may be it's weak spot, however, it's relatively good single core performance & IPC makes it still capable of handling (most) games. Overall desktop performance for browsing, media playback, etc, is perfectly fine. It appears to struggle more when paired with a mobile 1060 or higher, leaving the best choices for a laptop configuration being a 1050 / 1050 Ti. It's immediate successor, the i5-8300h, offers hyper-threading and a substantially higher turbo frequency, making it even better than the i7-7700hq from the same generation as this chip. The only way to justify getting a laptop with this cpu in 2022 would be if it's very cheap (used/refurbished), otherwise those interested in a more ""long term"" solution would be advised to opt for an 8th gen or newer mobile i5. It is now 5 years old, and for those who currently have one and are seeking to upgrade, newer 11th or 12th gen based machines will offer plentiful uplift for the money.

Not bad at all, especially considering the 45W TDP. You'll find these in entry-level laptops, however some models equip them with far more than entry-level graphics solutions. Take the Acer Nitro 5, for example, specifically the AN515-55-58WJ variant. It packages the little 10300H with a RTX2060 GPU - wow!

However Intel finally seems to be making smarter moves by making its I5 series dual threaded. This has the I5 10600kf out performing the R5 3600 without the need of an over clock. Then pushing 6 cores and 12 threads on at least 4.9GHz all core ratio is insanely good for a more compromising build. Taking in to consideration the I5 10600kf and a Z490 go for about $350 it is an easy buy when the R5 5600 goes for $350 alone and a R5 3600 with a oc'ing motherboard also pushes $450 to this day. The performance after the I5 overclock is easily comparable to the R5 5600. Keeping in mind for the same price as buying a I5 9600k/8600k and Z390. The difference the dual threads on Intels elite budget gaming cpus finally clouds the difference between performance of a I5, I7, I9 to be unnoticed in a gaming machine. This product also serves to compete with any AMD offer considering price to performance especially after an overclock. However in the contrary with the recent GPU pandemic, if you do not own a GPU I strongly recommend you spend a little extra and get the Vega 11 in the R5 3400g or the slightly faster vega 8 R5 5400g. However these Apu's only perform somewhere inbetween a GT1030 and a RX 560, with how bottom of the barrel that selection is I would truly recommend desperately looking for a fairly priced GPU, but the two Vega APU's should be a nice bit for okay/low quality gaming at 1080p but not anywhere near good fps in most cases.",3 years ago.

That does not mean I cannot run almost all settings on high or very high/ultra but there are odd spots with frame drops due to heavy CPU usage in that game...... With its 8 cores and 8 threads it handles Doom Eternal and RDR2 flawlessly though. If you find the K series for roughly the same price grab it, but if this guy is part of a bundle or on sale, you wont be disappointed with it when it comes to gaming or consumer desktop activities and a little beyond. It may be on its way out with the low clock speed by 2021 however, even with 8 cores and threads! I use Intel's XTU to force the turbo on for a longer duration and with a good air cooler it does not go above 60C, give or take another degree, so no power or thermal throttling at all! All around I would say this CPU is good but not outstanding.

Essentially, the 10850K is a worse binned 10900K, meaning that it may be a hundred or two megahertz slower than the 10900K and may not overclock as well as a standard 10900K. Otherwise, the 10850K is nearly identical to the 10900K. The 10850K is a very strong gaming and workstation CPU. With a sub-$400 price-tag, the 10850K has a similar pricing to the Ryzen 7 5800X. Gamers who want the faster overall gaming performance should go with the Ryzen 7 5800X, while users who want the best overclocking and a slightly better workstation/multi-core performance may want to stick with the 10850K. Note that Intel will be switching to a new chipset with their 12th generation Alder Lake processors, so the upgrade path is limited to Intel's 11th generation Rocket Lake processors, which is mostly not worth the upgrade. Also, as of Q1 of 2020, the 10900K remains $75-100 more expensive than the 10850K. There is just not enough performance gain for most users to justify the extra cost, so most users would be better off with a 10850K.

Most people won't do this or get close to it. When it's OC'd it can hit 10900K performance levels in some places but the quad channel memory doesn't really give much of a boost over the extra 3-4 MHz extra per core you'll get on the 10900K. Single core performance wasn't great on userbench but on 3DMark the 10900X actually does pretty well. My OC was top 98% on here and top 6% in 3DMark for the 10900X so maybe I just got lucky on the silicon lottery. Some guys seem to have pushed it to 5.3GHz or 5.4GHz but I don't want to push my voltage beyond 1.35v-1.37v If you're an old x299 sucker like me who thought quad memory would be a big boost for games then I would wait for 10nm Intel and upgrade.

Everything else costs way more just because it has an iGPU or can be overclocked, but a purchase of a 150€ 4770K really goes against all reason with parts like the 150€ 12100. I upgraded to this from my old i5-4440, which I have owned since launch. The extra frequency (locked through BIOS at 3.6 GHz compared to the i5's 3.2 GHz) and extra threads make a visible difference even in applications where you wouldn't expect it, but mostly in applications that make use of one or the other.

However, it does have one thing definitely going for it. Despite me having used it pretty much 24/7 for the past 7 years, and the SFF Optiplex 760 it's on, having only been cleaned 3-4 times in its' whole life, because I didn't know how to clean a PC until fairly recently. Yet the E5300 STILL runs after all these years, and only begun getting any noticeably slower in the past year or so. This kind of reliability is far more than what I can say for Intel's high end CPUs from just the past year. Because half a year ago I finally managed to get a new computer to replace my Optiplex. And so far I've somehow lost TWO CPUs in a row. First the original i5-11400f I had bought, and then the i5-11500 I bought as a replacement.",2 years ago.
